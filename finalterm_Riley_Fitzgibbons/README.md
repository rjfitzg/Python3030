I created a working version (run.py & script.py), realized that this was not what you wanted and them started working on that instead. I got stuck loading the file (https://api.teleport.org/api/urban_areas/) and ran out of time, as a json but if that was accomplished I think it would have worked perfectly.

I am including both sets of files bc they both accomplish what was asked just not in the way you wanted.

run.py & script.py are working but are the incorrect method you wanted.

run2.py and script2.py are not entirely working but are the method you wanted it to be accmomplished with.
